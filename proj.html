            <h1 id="title">What is Tobacco?</h1>
            <p>Tobacco is a plant whose leaves are fermented for a variety of uses. The leaves contain nicotine and many harmful chemicals.
                Nicotine is used in a number of different drugs and is highly addictive.
            </p>
            <h1 id="admin">How is it administered?</h1>
            <p>Tobacco is typically smoked (cigarettes, cigars, pipes) that deliver it to the brain very quickly.
                There are also e-cigarettes, snuff, and chewing tobacco. Nicotine is also sometimes used in the form of
                inhalers and gum to help people quit.
            </p>
            <div>
                <h1 id="body">How does it affect the body?</h1>
                <p>Beyond the direct impacts of nicotine, tobacco also includes many harmful chemicals with
                    other side effects. Some of these are increased risk of lung cancer, bronchitis, emphesyma,
                    heart disease, and many other forms of cancer. It impacts other people too, as second
                    hand smoke can cause cancer, heart disease, and other illnesses.
                </p>
                <h3 id="brain">The brain?</h3>
                <p>Nicotine is absorbed through the blood and taken to the brain. It causes
                    increased breathing and heart rate, while also releasing dopamine and triggering
                    the reward center of the brain.
                </p>
            </div>
            <h1 id="treat">Treatment</h1>
            <p>Nicotine specifically is considered to be extremely addictive, as it sends dopamine to the brain.
                This makes it extremely difficult to quit, but there are ways to do so. A major method used is Nicotine
                Replacement Therapy (NRT), where products (such as gums, patches, inhalers, and lozenges) with smaller
                amounts of nicotine are given to people with addictions to gradually reduce their dependence on it.
                These also do not have the same harmful chemicals found in cigarettes, making it safer. There are many
                other products that also decrease cravings without the use of nicotine as well. People can also see
                tobacco treatment specialists to help them quit.
